Array Initialization:

Create an empty Python list and populate it with integers from 1 to 10 using a loop. Print the resulting array.
Array Slicing:

Given an array of integers, write Python code to extract a subarray containing elements from index 2 to 5 (inclusive). Print the subarray.
Array Sum:

Write a Python function that calculates the sum of all the elements in an array of integers. Test it with an example array.
Array Maximum:

Find the maximum value in an array of integers using Python. Print both the maximum value and its index.
Array Reversal:

Write Python code to reverse an array of integers in-place, without using any additional data structures.
Array Sorting:

Sort an array of integers in ascending order using Python's built-in sorting function. Print the sorted array.
Array Search:

Write a Python function to search for a specific integer in an array. Return the index if found, or -1 if not found.
Array Concatenation:

Create two arrays of integers and concatenate them into a single array using Python. Print the concatenated array.
Array Removal:

Given an array of integers, remove all occurrences of a specific value using Python. Print the modified array.
Array Unique Elements:

Write Python code to remove duplicate elements from an array of integers while preserving the order of the remaining elements. Print the modified array.
